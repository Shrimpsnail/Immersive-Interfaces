## Welcome to the Immersive Interfaces / Immersive UI resource pack repository!

The Resource pack is not yet available through other means and is a heavy work in progress, and as such will only be available here for now. Any other releases have not been approved by me 

If you wish to give it a test run feel free to download it and give your feedback!


> [!WARNING]
> To use the pack it must be extracted from the downloaded file the final folder structure should be resourcepacks \ Immersive-Interfaces \ assets + pack.mcmeta


> [!NOTE]
> The required fonts are set in the English (United States) language, if you wish to use your own language you can execute the script created by @Wolphwood in [assets/minecraft/lang/$_langs.bat](https://github.com/Shrimpsnail/Immersive-Interfaces/blob/main/assets/minecraft/lang/%24_langs.bat)
